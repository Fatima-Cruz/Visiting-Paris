  <p class="description">

  <p class="title"> Notre Dame </p>
  <img class="toDoPic" src="images/notredame.jpg" alt="Notre Dame">
  <p class="description"> 
    The Notre Dame Cathedral, not to be confused with the University of Notre Dame nor the Disney movie, used to have free admission to Notre Dame. However, to enter the tower itself there <em>was</em> a fee of €8.50 <b>(≈$10) </b>and a fee of €6 <b>(≈$7)</b> to enter the crypt. 
    <br> <br>
    The medieval Catholic cathedral had the hearts of many with its historic organ, colourful rose windows, gargolye scultpures, immense church bells and religious imagery. The cathedral has remained tragically closed following the infamous fire of April 15, 2019.

  <p class="title"> The Catacombs </p>
  <img class="toDoPic" src="images/catacombs.jpg" alt="Catacombs">
  <p class="description"> 
    Care for some goosebumps and chills on a spooky adventure? Consider visiting The Catacombs of Paris for €24 <b>(≈$29)</b> with an advanced ticket, perhaps take your child for a scare for €5 <b>(≈$6) </b>. 'Last minute' same-day tickets are available for a lower price but with an increased hassle. Audio guides are also available for a little bit exta. 
    <br> <br>
   The Catacombs of Paris is a mass cemetery which holds over six million Parisians. The catacombs were previously open to visits under strict conditions. Later it was closed completely because of church opposition to exposing human remains to public display. Later, visit frequency slowly began to increase from one a month, twice a month to eventually allow visitors on a daily basis.
